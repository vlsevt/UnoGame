<h1>UnoGame</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">UnoGame is a digital C# version of the classic Uno card game, featuring fully implemented game logic that allows players to engage in exciting matches. Players can test the game either solo against themselves or enjoy it locally with another player.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The project includes robust state management, enabling players to save and load their game sessions via a database. This feature ensures that progress is preserved, allowing players to resume their games at any time.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">P.S. The AI behavior is not implemented, so it counts as a player.</p>
